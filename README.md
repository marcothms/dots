Everything is managed via `stow(1)`.

```bash
$ ./stow.sh 
Unknown option, exiting.
Use ./stow.sh --stow <folder_name> to deploy configuration
Use ./stow.sh --unstow <folder_name> to remove configuration
```

`helix(1)` should be built from [source](https://docs.helix-editor.com/install.html), remember to link the `runtime/`.
